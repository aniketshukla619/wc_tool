# WC Tool

The WC Tool is a command-line utility implemented in Python that provides functionality similar to the `wc` command in Unix-like systems. It allows you to count the number of lines, words, and characters in a given file.

## Installation

To use the WC Tool, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download and install Python from the official Python website.

## Usage

To use the WC Tool, open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the `wc.py` file is located. Then, run the following command:

```
python wc.py <filename>
```

Replace `<filename>` with the path to the file you want to analyze. The WC Tool will then display the number of lines, words, and characters in the specified file.

## Example

Let's say you have a file named `example.txt` that contains the following text:

```
Hello, world!
This is an example file.
```

To count the number of lines, words, and characters in this file using the WC Tool, run the following command:

```
python wc.py example.txt
```

The output will be:

```
Lines: 2
Words: 7
Characters: 38
```
